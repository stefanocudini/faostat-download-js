<b>Land-use statistics</b>
<br/>Data on agricultural land-use are valuable for conducting studies on a various perspectives concerning agricultural production, food security and for deriving cropping intensity among others uses. Indicators derived from the land-use categories can also elucidate the environmental sustainability of countries’ agricultural practices. FAOSTAT Land-use statistics contain a wide range of information on variables that are significant for: understanding the structure of a country’s agricultural sector; making economic plans and policies for food security; deriving environmental indicators, including those related to investment in agriculture and data on gross crop area and net crop area which are useful for policy formulation and monitoring.

<b>Land-use resources sub-domain covers:</b>
<br/><br/>
Country area (including area under inland water bodies), Land area (excluding area under inland water bodies), Agricultural area, Arable land and Permanent crops, Arable land, Permanent crops, Permanent meadows and pastures, Forest area, Other land and Area equipped for irrigation. Detailed information on sub-categories: Temporary crops, Temporary meadows and pastures, Fallow land (temporary: less than 5 years), Permanent meadows and pastures cultivated and naturally grown and Organic land. Data are available from 1961 to 2009 for more than 200 countries and areas. Forest area: Global Forest Resource Assessment 2010 (FRA 2010) is the main source of forest area data in FAOSTAT. Data were provided by countries for years 1990, 2000, 2005 and 2010. Data for intermediate years were estimated for FAO using linear interpolation and tabulation.
<br/><br/>
<b>Questionnaire</b>
<br/><br/>
The annual FAO land resource questionnaire is the primary source of country land-use data. The data collected from the questionnaires are from official national sources. Starting from 2001, the land-use questionnaire was revised in order to obtain further information on the land-use sub-categories as well as areas that are actually irrigated. Starting in 2010, the FAO Statistics Division Land resource questionnaire includes items on land used for organic production and land in conversion to organic production. The new items in the questionnaire are: agricultural area certified organic, agricultural area in conversion to organic, arable area organic, arable area in conversion to organic, permanent crops area organic, permanent crops in conversion to organic, permanent meadows and pastures area organic and permanent meadows and pastures in conversion to organic. If official data about Organic land have not been provided, the information has been supplemented by other sources such as the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture FiBL and the Mediterranean Organic Agriculture Network, MOAN.
<br/><br/>
<b>Secondary sources</b>
<br/><br/>
The data collected from official national sources through the questionnaire are supplemented with information from official secondary data sources. The secondary sources cover: official country data from websites of national ministries, national publications and related country data reported by various international organizations.
