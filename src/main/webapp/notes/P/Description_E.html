<br>
<p>The Prices domain of FAOSTAT contains:<br><br />

<ul style="padding-left:20px"> 
<li><strong>Annual Producer Prices</strong> or prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals and livestock primary products as collected at the farm-gate or at the first point of sale. Data are provided through annual questionnaires for over 130 countries and for some 200 commodities, representing over 97 percent of the worldâ€™s value of gross agricultural production (at 2004-2006 International Dollar Prices).</li>

<br /><br />Producer Prices are provided in three units: i) Local Currency Units (LCU); ii) Standard Local Currency (SLC); and, iii) US Dollars. Although, both LCU and SLC denote prices in the local currency of a country, there is an important distinction between the two units. Prices in LCU refer to the currency prevailing in a country in the year of data reporting. Thus, if there is (are) currency change(s) in a country during the years for which data is available, the data series will refer to more than one currency. Please see the <a class='goto' id='PCU_Notes' target="_self"><u>Currency Table</u><a/> in the Producer Prices webpage for information on currencies. Prices in SLC are standardised to reflect data in one currency only, normally the currency in the most recent year of data reporting. Having price data series in the same currency helps in obtaining consistent data series and is needed for analysing time series data or constructing price indices.

<br /><br />Producer Prices contains data from 1991 onwards, whilst the <a href="http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/download/PA/*/E">Price Archive</a> contains historical data from 1966 to 1990. However, these two data sets may not always be comparable. Please see the <a href="http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/download/PA/*/E">Price Archive</a> page for more information.

<br /><br />Whilst countries are requested by FAO to provide prices received by farmers, it is possible that some countries do not collect such prices and may report an alternative set of data, mainly, wholesale prices or unit values compiled for national accounts. Please visit the <a href="http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/download/PP/*/E">Country Notes</a> in the Producer Prices webpage for country-specific information.

<br /><br />When countries do not provide data for certain commodities and years, these prices are estimated, so that it is possible to compile regional aggregates and derived indicators. When no official figures can be used as a reference point on which to base the estimation, i.e. when the estimations are in fact extrapolations, these data series are not disseminated externally. However, extrapolated prices and their corresponding estimation methodology can be provided upon request (by contacting <a href="mailto:Price-Statistics@fao.org?Subject=Price%20estimations">
Price-Statistics@fao.org)</a>.<br /><br />

<li><strong>Monthly producer prices</strong>, collected from 2010 onwards. The availability of infra-annual data on prices allows a better understanding of price responses to short term shocks, which are a major feature of agricultural markets. They also enable a more timely and accurate monitoring of prices received by farmers and how these are transmitted along the value chain. These prices are provided in Local Currency Units (LCU) only. They are based on the same definitions and concepts than Annual Producer Prices and are provided according to the same classification of commodities. Monthly prices are collected in conjunction with annual prices and updated yearly.
</li>
<br /><br />
<li><strong>Annual Producer Price Indices</strong> that measure the average annual change in the prices received by farmers. Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. Producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise the Agriculture Producer Price Index, Commodity group indices and Single item indices.
</li>

<br /><br /><li><strong>Consumer price indices</strong>, annual and monthly (or quarterly) of all items, covering all goods and services, and for the food and non-alcoholic beverages group. These indices measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire for consumption. These indices are originally compiled and disseminated by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).
