In the year 1995 the price series in the FAOSTAT were interrupted for some time due to resource constraints. Due to lack of resources detailed work could not be done for countries which have not provided any basic data and also for the period ending in 1990. Historical data on producer prices being compiled and disseminated earlier are still available under Price Archive. However, for various known reasons the two data-sets may differ in the overlapping year of 1991. FAO Statistics Division would not like to give any explanation for differences in the two sets. Users using a combination of two sets may keep this limitation in mind.
