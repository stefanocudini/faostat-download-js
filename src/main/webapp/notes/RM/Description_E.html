	<li><b>Bangladesh:</b> Ploughs data refer to the number of farm families assuming that each farm family has one plough. Source: Agriculture Information Service, Ministry of Agriculture (reference 2007 FAO Resources questionnaire)</li>
	<li><b>Canada:</b> in Agricultural censuses prior to 1996, the agricultural operations reported the farm vehicles, machinery and equipment located on their operations on Census Day, regardless of ownership. In 1996 and 2001, however, operators reported all farm vehicles, machinery and equipment that they owned or leased from others. The change affects the comparability of the 1996 and 2001 data with data from previous censuses. Starting in 1986, Agricultural tractors data include Garden tractors; from 2001, they also include all-terrain vehicles. Source: StatisticsCanada, Census of Agriculture</li>
