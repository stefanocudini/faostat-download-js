The FAO indices of agricultural producer prices measure the average annual change over time in the selling prices received by farmers (prices at the farm-gate or at the first point of sale. The indices are constructed using price data in Standardised Local Currency (SLC). 


<br /><br />
There are two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT:


<ul class='bullet-list'>
<li>Agriculture Producer Price Index This is an aggregate index for all primary crops and livestock products. For a country, the aggregate would include all primary crops and livestock products that are produced in that country, and for which both production and producer price data are available. 


</li>
<li>
Price indices are also available for individual commodities, subject to data availability. Examples of these include: 
<ul class='bullet-list'>
<li>Wheat Producer Price Index </li>
<li>Rice, paddy Producer Price Index </li>
<li>Maize Producer Price Index</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
Data source: The main source of data for producer prices and production is the data reported by countries to FAO. This data is available in FAOSTAT in the Prices and Production data domains.
 Coverage of countries: The
indices are available for all countries for which both price and production data are disseminated in FAOSTAT. Reference year:
The base years of the indices are 2004-2006. The weight used for the aggregate index (Agriculture Producer Price Index) is the
average production value for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006. Time period: The indices are available from 1999 to the latest year
of data availability. Methodology: The Agriculture Producer Price Index is calculated by the Laspeyres formula. The index is
calculated by summing the SLC price for a given year multiplied by production quantity in base year for all items in the
aggregate and dividing by the sum of the SLC price in the base year multiplied by production quantity for the base year for the
same items.
