<b>Annual Series of Demographic Estimates</b>
<br/><br/>
Time reference
<br/>
The estimates refer to mid-year assessments.

Explanatory notes
<br/>
The annual series of demographic estimates, which are stored in this domain, consist of the following: 
<ul class='bullet-list'>
<li>total population by sex </li>
<li>urban and rural population </li>
<li>agricultural and non-agricultural population (AP and NON-AP) </li>
<li>total economically active population or labour force (EAP) by sex </li>
<li>economically active population (or labour force) in agriculture (EAPA) by sex </li>
</ul>
The annual series cover the period 1961-2010. 
The total population series have been obtained from the UN Population Division, which prepares estimates and projections of the total population by sex and age for each fifth year from 1950 to 2050. These series are biennially revised and the present ones refer to the 2010 revision ("World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision", United Nations, New York, 2011). As part of this biennial exercise the UN also derives annual estimates by interpolation. The figures for 1961-2010 presented here were extracted from the thus derived annual series. 
The urban/rural population, the economically active population and the agricultural/non-agricultural population segments were obtained by systematically applying to the total population the series of relevant ratios (i.e. proportion of urban population, proportion of economically active population by sex and age, etc). 
The annual series of the ratios of the urban/rural population and the total economically active population have been derived through interpolation of the series of ratios underlying the related long-term estimates and projections prepared by the UN (quinquennial series) and ILO (decennial series), respectively. For reference see: "World Urbanization Prospects: The 2009 Revision" (UN, New York, 2010) and "Economically active population, 1980-2020: The 5th Revision"(ILO, Geneva, 2008).
