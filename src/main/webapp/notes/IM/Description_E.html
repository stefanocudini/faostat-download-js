Other agricultural tractors data: about 80% of the tractors are used in agriculture. <em>Source: Annual Questionnaire 2008</em>. Starting in 2003 the data refer to estimation relating to the agricultural sector as provided by Statistics Norway, Division for Primary Industry Statistics on the 2010 Annual questionnaire. </p>

<p><em><strong>Canada: </strong></em>in Agricultural censuses prior to 1996, the agricultural operations reported the farm vehicles, machinery and equipment located on their operations on Census Day, regardless of ownership.

The change affects the comparability of the 1996 and 2001 data with data from previous censuses.
