Led by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (<b>ASTI</b>) is a trusted comprehensive source of information on agricultural R&D statistics. 
<br/><br/>
ASTI's mission is to provide up-to-date quantitative and qualitative data and subsequent analyses on investment, capacity, and institutional trends in agricultural research and development (R&D) in low- and middle-income countries that will assist R&D managers and policymakers in improved policy formulation and decision making at national, regional, and global levels.
<br/><br/>
ASTI has published a broad set of country and regional reports and analytical publications that examine agricultural R&D trends at national, regional; and global levels, while at the same time providing comparative data on agricultural R&D performance across countries and regions.
